      <h4 class="font-weight-bold mb-4">Necessary foods in pregnant time</h4>
  <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">1.Dairy products </h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">During</span> pregnancy, you need to consume extra protein and calcium to meet the needs of the growing fetus .
Dairy products contain two types of high-quality protein: casein and whey. Dairy is the best dietary source of calcium, and provides high amounts of phosphorus, various B vitamins, magnesium and zinc.
Yogurt, especially Greek yogurt, is particularly beneficial for pregnant women.It contains more calcium than most other dairy products. Some varieties also contain probiotic bacteria, which support digestive health.</p>
      <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2">2. Legumes </h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">This</span> group of food includes lentils, peas, beans, chickpeas, soybeans and peanuts.
Legumes are excellent plant-based sources of fiber, protein, iron, folate (B9) and calcium — all of which your body needs more of during pregnancy.
Folate is one of the B vitamins (B9). It’s very important for the health of the mother and fetus, especially during the first trimester.
However, most pregnant women are not consuming nearly enough folate .
This has been linked with an increased risk of neural tube defects and low birth weight. Insufficient folate intake may also cause your child to become more prone to infections and disease later in life.Some varieties also contain probiotic bacteria, which support digestive health.</p>
<div class="card" style="background-color: #e3f2fd;">
  <div class="card-body" style="color: green;">
    Legumes are great sources of folate, fiber and many other nutrients. Folate is a very important nutrient during pregnancy and may reduce the risk of some birth defects and diseases.
  </div>
</div>

<h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">3. Sweet Potatoes </h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Sweet</span>potatoes are an excellent source of beta-carotene, which your body transforms into vitamin A. Vitamin A is important for the growth and differentiation of cells in your growing fetus.</p>
 <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">4. Salmon </h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Salmon</span>contains the essential omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, which are important for brain and eye development in your growing baby. It’s also a natural source of vitamin D.</p>
 <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">5. Eggs </h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Whole</span>eggs are incredibly nutritious and a great way to increase your overall nutrient intake. They also contain choline, an essential nutrient for brain health and development.</p>
 <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">6. Broccoli and Dark, Leafy Greens</h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Broccoli</span> and dark, green vegetables, such as kale and spinach, contain many of the nutrients pregnant women need.

These include fiber, vitamin C, vitamin K, vitamin A, calcium, iron, folate and potassium.

Furthermore, broccoli and leafy greens are rich in antioxidants. They also contain plant compounds that benefit the immune system and digestion.</p>
<h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">7. Lean Meat</h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Beef</span> , pork and chicken are excellent sources of high-quality protein.

Furthermore, beef and pork are also rich in iron, choline and other B vitamins — all of which are needed in higher amounts during pregnancy.

Iron is an essential mineral that is used by red blood cells as a part of hemoglobin. It’s important for delivering oxygen to all cells in your body.

Pregnant women need more iron since their blood volume is increasing. This is particularly important during the third trimester.

Low levels of iron during early and mid-pregnancy may cause iron deficiency anemia, which doubles the risk of premature delivery and low birth weight .</p>

<div class="card" style="background-color: #e3f2fd; margin-top: 1.5cm;">
  <div class="card-body" style="color: green;">
    Pregnant women need more iron since their blood volume is increasing. This is particularly important during the third trimester.Leafy Greens. Leafy greens, such as spinach, kale, swiss chard, collard and beet greens contain between 2.5–6.4 mg of iron per cooked cup, or 14–36% of the RDI.

</div>
<h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">8. Avocados </h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Avocados</span> contain high amounts of monounsaturated fatty acids, fiber, folate and potassium. They may help improve fetal health and relieve leg cramps that are common in pregnant women.</p>
 <h5 class="font-weight-bold mb-2" style="margin-top: 1cm;">9. Water</h5>
 <p > <span style="margin-left: 5cm;">Broccoli</span> During pregnancy, blood volume increases by up to 1.5 liters or about 50 ounces. Therefore, it’s important to stay properly hydrated.
Your fetus usually gets everything it needs, but if you don’t watch your water intake, you may become dehydrated.
Symptoms of mild dehydration include headaches, anxiety, tiredness, bad mood and reduced memory.
Furthermore, increasing your water intake may help relieve constipation and reduce your risk of urinary tract infections, which are common during pregnancy .
General guidelines recommend drinking about 68 ounces or 2 liters of water per day, but the amount you really need varies by individual.
As an estimate, you should be drinking about 34–68 ounces (1–2 liters) each day. Just keep in mind that you also get water from other foods and beverages, such as fruit, vegetables, coffee and tea.</p>
<div class="card" style="background-color: #e3f2fd;">
  <div class="card-body" style="color: green;">
    Drinking water is important as your blood volume increases during pregnancy. Adequate hydration may also help prevent constipation and urinary tract infections.
